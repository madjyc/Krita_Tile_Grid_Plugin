# Krita "Tile Grid" Plugin

**Tile Grid** lets you create a regular set of guides defining "tiles" (or "cells") with customizable dimensions, aspect ratios, and spacing.
This tool is ideal for designing basic **tilesets**, **photoboards**, **storyboard layouts**, or even **single frames with user-defined margins**.

*Tested in Krita 5.2.6*

## Installation

1. Download the plugin: Click on the big green <kbd><> Code</kbd> button, then click on <kbd>Download ZIP</kbd> (or just click [here](https://github.com/madjyc/Krita_Tile_Grid_Plugin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)).

2. Install the plugin in Krita (as a ZIP file, don't extract it yourself!): Start Krita, go to the menu `Tools` > `Scripts` > `Import Python Plugin from File...`, locate the plugin (ZIP file) and press <kbd>OK</kbd>. A popup will ask you if you want to enable the plugin. Click on <kbd>Yes</kbd>, then **restart Krita**.

You can now use the plugin by clicking on the menu `Tools` > `Scripts` > `Tile Grid`.

*If needed, you'll find more information on how to install Krita python plugins [here](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/python_scripting/install_custom_python_plugin.html)*.

## How to use the plugin

Very simple:

- Enter the **`margins`** you want for the grid;
- Enter the **`minimum spacing`** you want between tiles;
- Enter the desired number of **`columns`** and **`rows`** of tiles;
- Specify the **`format ratio`** (i.e. width/height) for the tiles.

You're done! The plugin will automatically calculate the size of the tiles based on the canvas size and create guides accordingly.

Oh and you can save your settings as a **`preset`** and restore them later.

Feel free to contact me on [Krita Artists](https://krita-artists.org/), there should be a thread dedicated to this plugin in the forum.

#### Hope you enjoy this plugin!
